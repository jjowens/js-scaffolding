# js-scaffolding
Javascript library to create Visual Studio Studio projects using Dotnet Cli commands.

This is a very rough draft. Do not use for production!

## Basic commands

There is only one working template at the moment; "aspnet-core". The command/syntax are not correct at the moment. Change Project name to your preference

```
npm run scaffold --templatename="aspnet-core" --projectname="Random"
```
