# js-scaffolding
Javascript library to create Visual Studio Studio projects using Dotnet Cli commands.

This is a very rough draft. Do not use for production!

## Basic commands

There is only one working template at the moment; "aspnet-core". It will generate Netcore App 3.1 project and add project references to the main website. Change "projectname" to your preference

```
npm run scaffold --templatename="aspnet-core" --projectname="Bookshop"
```
